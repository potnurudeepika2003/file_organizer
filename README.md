This project is a **Task Manager Dashboard** built with **React + Firebase + Tailwind CSS**, designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently.  
It features secure authentication (Signup, Login, Forgot Password) and a dynamic dashboard layout.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`  
**Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.

## 🔧 Environment Setup  

Before running the app, create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your Firebase configuration:  

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id


Make sure your `.env` file is **listed in `.gitignore`** to keep your keys private.
